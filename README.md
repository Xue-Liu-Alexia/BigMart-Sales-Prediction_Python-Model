# BigMart_Sales_Prediction_Python_Model
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for numerous products across many stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

# Business Problem
Build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.
